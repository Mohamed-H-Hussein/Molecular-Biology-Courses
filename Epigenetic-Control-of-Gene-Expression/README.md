## 📚 Course Overview  
This course explores how gene expression can be regulated beyond the DNA sequence itself — a field known as **epigenetics**. You'll learn how **chromatin structure**, **DNA methylation**, **histone modifications** and **non-coding RNAs** such as miRNAs,which influences gene expression in both health and disease. It focuses on mammalian systems and includes important discussions of **epigenetic dysregulation in cancer**, **X-chromosome inactivation**, **genomic imprinting** and **transgenerational inheritance**.

## 🎯 Relevance to My Field  

This course is directly relevant to my current master’s research focus in molecular cancer biology. It strengthened my understanding of **how epigenetic modifications influence gene regulation** and how this can be involved in diseases such as cancer. It enhanced my knowledge of mechanisms such as **DNA methylation**, **histone modification** and **X-chromosome inactivation**, all of which are key to cancer epigenetics. Additionally, it provided detailed insights into the **therapeutic potential of targeting epigenetic modifiers** for treatment.
