## 🧠 Course Description

This course introduces the basic concepts of classical genetics, population genetics and evolutionary biology. It covers how traits are inherited, how genetic variation arises and is passed on and how populations evolve over time. The course also explores important  key methods such as genetic mapping, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and molecular phylogenetics. Aspecial attention is given to real-world applications of evolutionary theory in fields like health, ancestry and biodiversity.

## 🔬 Relevance to My Field

As a Master’s student in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology specializing in Molecular Cancer Biology and Bioinformatics, this course provided me with a structured understanding of genetic variation, inheritance and population-level genetic dynamics—essential when analyzing tumor heterogeneity, somatic mutations, or even studying the genetic basis of disease susceptibility. The detailed essential explanation of GWAS, recombination mapping and natural selection mechanisms helped me very much to bridge my background in molecular biology with computational approaches used in genome analysis.

It also clarified key population genetics concepts—such as Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, genetic drift and dN/dS ratios—which frequently appear in other cancer genomics studies and variant interpretation pipelines.
