## 🧠 Key Concepts & Takeaways

- Mendelian genetics forms the foundation of the modern inheritance understanding.
- Evolution is not "just a theory" but supported by a  very wide range of evidence.
- Population-level approaches (Hardy-Weinberg, gene flow) reveal forces shaping of the genetic variation.
- Natural selection and genetic drift act in different contexts, both critical in evolution.
- GWAS and recombination mapping are very powerful tools to study trait–gene relationships.
- Behavioral traits and speciation mechanisms show the breadth of evolutionary biology.
