# 🧬 Molecular Biology Courses Repository

This repository contains my structured course summaries and reflective notes from selected online molecular biology courses.
This collection highlights my personal learning journey through selected online courses that I completed independently alongside my M.Sc. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, with a focus on both Molecular Cancer Biology and Bioinformatics.  
The courses span  in essential key topics such as epigenetics, classical genetics, gene regulation and genome interpretation, all of which have direct relevance to my research field.

## 🧠 Why These Courses?

As a Master's student in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology specializing in Molecular Cancer Biology and Bioinformatics, these courses were chosen to:

- Strengthen my core knowledge in both molecular genetics and gene regulation  
- Explore epigenetic mechanisms relevant to the cancers development and therapy  
- Understand the classical experiments that shaped current tools like sequencing technologies 
- Bridge theoretical foundations with a modern computational interpretation of gene function and cancer-associated mutations

These courses supported my academic research by enhancing both conceptual understanding and practical insight into genetic and epigenetic mechanisms relevant to human diseases.
