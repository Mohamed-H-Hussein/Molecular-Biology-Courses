## 🧠 Relevance to My Field

As a Master's student specializing in **Biochemistry** and **MolecularBiology** focusing on **Molecular Cancer Biology** and **Bioinformatics**, this course provided an essential conceptual foundation. It deepened my understanding of:
- For The origin and experimental validation of genetic principles still used in cancer genomics today.
- Mechanisms of the mutagenesis, suppression and genetic code interpretation — which is relevant to cancer mutations.
- Early models of gene regulation of the (lac, arabinose and lambda) that laid the groundwork for modern **epigenetics** and **transcriptional control**.
- Experimental approaches that inspired current tools like CRISPR and gene-editing strategies.
- Historical context that sharpens my **critical evaluation skills** in analyzing biological data.
