## 🧠 Relevance to My Field

As a Master’s student focusing on **Molecular Cancer Biology** and **Bioinformatics**, this course added crucial perspective on RNA structure and function. I gained a clearer understanding and view of:

- RNA structural logic, important for **non-coding RNAs** relevant to cancer.  
- Translation control and how **ribosome fidelity** affects protein output.  
- Mechanisms of **ribosome-targeting antibiotics**, with implications in cancer therapy.  
- The potential of **RNA-based design tools** for both diagnostics and therapeutics.  
- The use of **interactive visualization tools** like Eterna to strengthen RNA-based problem-solving.

## 🛠️ Skills Acquired

- Evaluation of **RNA base pairing** and structural stability  
- Recognition of **2D and 3D RNA motifs** like hairpins, pseudoknots, junctions  
- Understanding **mRNA decoding** and use of codon tables  
- Describing **ribosomal translation mechanisms** and the peptidyl transferase center  
- Applying of both **genetic code expansion** and ribosomal engineering principles  
- Analysis of RNA-targeting **antibiotics**  
- Hands-on RNA design through the **Eterna puzzle challenges**
