# 🧬 Notes: DNA Decoded 

---

## 📍 Module 1: Cracking the Genetic Code

- Basic building blocks: nucleotides (A, T, C, G)
- Discovery of DNA structure (by Watson & Crick Module)
- Complementary base pairing
- DNA packaging: histones → nucleosomes → chromosomes
- Covalent vs non-covalent bonds in DNA stability
- DNA unzip during replication process 

---

## 📍 Module 2: Getting the Message Across

- Central Dogma: DNA → RNA → Protein
- Transcription: mRNA synthesis mechanisms
- Translation: decoding mRNA at ribosomes into amino acid chains
- PCR Function: DNA amplification  
- Gel electrophoresis: can be used for DNA fingerprinting
- Virtual lab: forensic DNA analysis of a crime scene

---

## 📍 Module 3: Manipulating DNA

- Restriction enzymes: identifying and cutting specific DNA sequences
- Plasmid cloning and recombinant DNA in bacteria (e.g., E. coli)
- Mutation types and their effects which couldbe (beneficial, neutral, harmful)
- Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs): creation and safety debates
- Labster virtual simulation: cloning blue tomato gene

---

## 📍 Module 4: DNA and Me

- Human Genome Project: sequencing the human genome
- Ancient DNA: extracting from extinct species (e.g., mammoths)
- Personal genomics:
  - SNPs and genetic variations
  - Genetic ancestry testing (as example, AncestryDNA)
  - **Pharmacogenomics**: personalized medicine based on genetic profile 
- Ethical considerations of reviving extinct species

## 🔬 Key Takeaways

- DNA sequence determines both biological traits and diversity.
- Molecular tools like PCR and electrophoresis enable forensic and diagnostic applications.
- Genetic engineering impacts medicine, agriculture and biodiversity.
- Pharmacogenomics bridges genetics and personalized therapy for optimized outcomes.
