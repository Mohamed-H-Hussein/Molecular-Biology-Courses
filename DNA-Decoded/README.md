## 🧠 Course Description

This introductory course explores the fundamentals of DNA: its structure, how it replicates, how it is translated into proteins, and how scientists can analyze and manipulate it. Learners will dive into real-world applications such as DNA fingerprinting, genetic testing, GMOs and also the Human Genome Project. The course also includes interactive virtual labs for forensic analysis and molecular cloning simulations.
